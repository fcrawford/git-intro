# A Slack + Git workflow for collaboration 

For collaboration with me and most other academic researchers, there is a simple workflow that will work well for you.  

Write on the Slack channel what you are going to work on today. If another person is also working, say which files, and ask that they don't mess with the files you are changing. 

small commits, push often. 

after you make your last commit, summarize the changes. 

Use the README.md to keep a todo list and summarize progress.  This will become the public introduction to your project.

# Workflows

Creating a new repo from scratch

Creating a new repo from an existing directory

Looking at the code for another project

Contributing to another project 

Collaborating on an academic project

Branch + merge

Pull requests

# Best practices 

Plan and communicate with your collaborators.  Who is working on what, and when? 

small, frequent commits

diffs are line-based, so make lines small. 

break up code into several files. 

Create a branch to experiment. 

communicate to manage merge conflicts

Every day, list the things you want to do, and separate them conceptually into discrete tasks.  Your goal is to make each of these separate commits.  

Don't leave uncommitted changes at the end of the day. Push everything to remote. 

Never add auxiliary files to a repo.  Use the `.gitignore` file to manage. 

---

# Using Git on your own

You may wish to use GitHub to host a private repo that you are working on alone.  For example, your CV or a project you are not ready to share yet.  

Maybe want to get the benefits of automatic versioning, offsite storage, and easy syncing between machines, but aren't ready to share with others.

Consideration for Tex/LaTeX documents

break up files
small lines
never add aux, log, out, bbl, blg, pdf (unless image) to the repo.  Only what is necessary to compile. 

use a Makefile to compile 

---

Considerations for R packages

The repo is the package.  README is descriptive.  Don't commit auto-generated files.
